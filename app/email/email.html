				<h4>Disclaimer:</h4>
				<p>The tax calculations are only approximate and include the following (estimated) non-refundable tax credits: the basic personal tax amount, CPP contributions, EI premiums, and the Canada employment amount.</p>

				<p>Although we do our best to provide an accurate tool to approximate tax savings and liability risks, we cannot guarantee any tax savings or an accurate risk assessment of your business. We recommend that you speak with an accountant, tax professional or lawyer to determine your actual tax savings and the risks in operating your business.</p>
