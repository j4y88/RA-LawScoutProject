Your form url with included id will have a post url that will need to be placed within the controller/service.js file on line 108.
 
After setting up the signup form. You will need to add the provided email template. Go to the Admin dashboard and go to templates at the top nav. Create template and choose paste code. Copy and paste the inline email code provided and save.
 
Afterwards automation rule should be added to allow automatic email posting will be done once the user finishes the form. To do so, go to the administrative dashboard and select automation on the top nav. Create a new workflow with the Welcome Email function. Setup the initial desired information. Set the trigger to immediately (the default is after 1 day). Select the provided email template in the saved templates section. Finish up the setup following the instructions and the automation workflow should be complete.
 
Anyone that completes the form will receive an email from Mailchimp to confirm the email. After the user confirms the email. Mailchimp servers will automatically send the email template with personal response to the userâ€™s provided email.
